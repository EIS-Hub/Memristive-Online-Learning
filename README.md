# Memristive-Online-Learning

This repo is dedicated to James' Master Thesis project. The goal of the project is to perform online learning on an analog memristive hardware substrate.
James will progressively introduce hardware constraints to see which are the ones that are critical for correct learning.
Different online learning algorithms will be experimented to see which one is better suited for the hardware substrate.
